====================
== HOW TO INSTALL ==
====================
	Move to the directory 'src', and type:
		make
	and then,
		make install
	That's all.

=========================
== using Boost library ==
=========================
By default, BioSequence::find_motif() is not compiled.
To use it, see README in the 'src' directory.

================================
== creating your own programs ==
================================
To create your own application programs or libraries
using the CBA library (libcba.a),
the 'cba.tmpl' provides convenient templates for
applications, utilities, and Makefile.
Copy the directory 'cba.tmpl' to a proper directory;
	e.g.,
	tar cvf - cba.tmpl | ( cd /your/directory; tar xvf -)
and read the README file therein.


This version of CBA was tested using GNU C++ 3.2 with Boost 1.31.0 on Linux.
