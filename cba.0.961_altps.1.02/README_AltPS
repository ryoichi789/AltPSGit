1. Install CBA(including_AltPS)

  AltPS is installed with CBA.

  Move to the directory 'src', and type:

  > make

  and then,

  > make install

   (The use of optimizing compiler options is recommended.)

2. Using AltPS

  [Synopsis]

  > altps -q query_file_pdb1 -t target_file_pdb2 -o directory_name [OPTIONS]


  [Options]
   
   -q : query PDB filename

   -t : target PDB filename

   -o : output directory (current directory by default)

   -size : minimun size (atom number) for matching surface area [int] 
           (30 by default)

   -zscore : minimun z-score for matching surface area [float]
             (4.0 by default)


  [Output files]
    
    molname1_molname2_region.list:
       - list of detected similar local surface areas
         region_#id, atom numbers, similarity score, Z-score are contained

    olname1_molname2_region_#id_alignment.list:
       - alignment list of local surface atoms at region_#id

    molname1_molname2_region_#id_area_q/t.pdb:
       - superposed local surface areas at region_#id

    molname1_molname2_region_#id_protein_q/t.pdb:
       - superposed input protein structures at region_#id

    molname1_molname2_region_#id_spp.dat:
       - superposition parameters (shift vector and rotation matrix) for the query protein
       - shift vector (the center of gravity is at the origin)
	     rotation matrix
	     shift vector (the gravity center of the target protein)

3. Examples

  Move to the directory 'sample'

  > ./altps -q 1tpo.pdb -t 2prk.pdb -o results

  You can obtain output files at direcory './results'.
