== mksrc.pl ==
==============
The Perl script 'mksrc.pl' creates templates for program files.
For example, to create an application, say, 'your_app',
execute the command:
	mksrc.pl -o your_app -a y
then, two files 'your_app.h' and 'your_app.cpp' will be created,
which contain barebone source codes to use as initial header and
implementation files for the application.
To create a utility class, say, 'YourClass', execute the command:
	mksrc.pl -o your_class
then, two files 'your_class.h' and 'your_class.cpp' will be created,
which contain barebone source codes to use as initial header and
implementations files for the class.

==============
Use Makefile2 as a template when you use Boost.
